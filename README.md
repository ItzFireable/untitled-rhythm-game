# C++ based Rhythm Game

## Information

This is a basic rhythm game project I am doing for fun using C++. I do not have a lot of experience, nor do I have plans to continue this for a long time, but we will see.

## Get started
###### Detailed instructions will come later, good luck to anyone trying this out.

To get the repository loaded, you need to clone it with --recurse-submodules.
There are .bat files to get it loaded up on Windows, depending on CMake. 


## Resources
This project uses `SDL3`, `SDL3_ttf`, `SDL3_image` and `OpenAL` as its dependencies. It also uses [stb_vorbis.c](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c), [dr_mp3.h](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_mp3.h) and [dr_wav](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_wav.h).
